Hereâ€™s a cleaned-up version of your plan with a crisp AI implementation path.

ðŸŒ± Hackathon Idea: Plant Disease Diagnosis Chatbot
Frontend (Mukil+Lakshya+ maybe Bhavya)
Design: Figma (Mukil)


Implementation: React PWA (Lakshya, with Bhavyaâ€™s support if available)


Features:


Upload/capture photo


Chatbot UI (text + voice)


Multilingual interface


Optional offline install (PWA manifest + service worker)



Backend (Bhavya+Rudy + maybe Lakshya)
Core API (FastAPI):


Accepts image â†’ calls disease detection model â†’ returns result


Integrates weather API + nearby farmer data for context engineering


Routes queries to LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) for conversational answers


Additional modules:


Farmer network clustering (mocked for hackathon)


Preventive alerts based on weather + disease trends



AI / ML Component (Rudy + maybe Bhavya)
(Rudyâ€™s responsibility, with Python stack)
1. Choose Pre-trained Model
Use PlantVillage dataset-based models (many open-source):


MobileNetV2 / EfficientNet fine-tuned on crop leaf diseases


Already available as TensorFlow Lite (.tflite) â†’ perfect for fast inference


Hackathon-friendly option:


Import directly from tensorflow_hub or Hugging Face Models


Skip training, just demo inference


2. Pipeline
Farmer uploads photo


Preprocess: resize (224Ã—224), normalize pixels


Run inference with CNN model â†’ disease label + confidence


Map label to remedies JSON (treatment advice, organic + chemical)


Send response to chatbot layer


3. Tech Stack
Python + TensorFlow/PyTorch for inference


FastAPI to wrap model in REST API


Optional: Convert to ONNX or TFLite for faster inference if deployed on mobile later


4. Hackathon Demo Scope
Support 3â€“5 common crops/diseases only


Keep remedies hardcoded JSON for speed


No need to retrain â†’ just load model and run inference



Voice Support
Frontend: Speech-to-text (Web Speech API) + Text-to-speech (Speech Synthesis API)


Backend (optional): Use Google Cloud STT/TTS if you want better accuracy for Indian languages



âœ… AI Deliverable by Rudy:
A disease_detector.py that:

 from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np

model = load_model("plant_disease_model.h5")

def predict_disease(image_path):
    img = Image.open(image_path).resize((224,224))
    x = np.array(img)/255.0
    x = np.expand_dims(x, axis=0)
    preds = model.predict(x)
    disease_idx = np.argmax(preds)
    return disease_idx, float(np.max(preds))


Wrap this inside FastAPI â†’ /predict endpoint.

# AuraFarm Backend Flowchart

This flowchart outlines the two main operational modes of the AuraFarm backend: **Diagnosis Mode** (when an image is provided) and **Conversational Mode** (when only a text prompt is sent).
